# Kevin-Cookie-Company-Financials

This is my first individual project using PowerBi where I have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyse the profit earned by Kevin Cookie Company through the years.
In the project I have: 
  - Used various parameters to drill down into the worksheet and customize it using filters and slicers.
  - Used different types of customized visualizations like bar chart, line chart and maps.

Using the aforementioned parameters I was able to analyse the following KPIs:

  - Profit by year and month,
  - Overall profit by country,
  - Sum of units sold in different countries, and
  - Overall profit by product

***Kevin Cookie Company Financials.xlsx*** contains the dataset for this project. **Here is a screenshot of how the dataset looks like.**
